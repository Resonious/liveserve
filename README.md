Liveserve
=============

A weird little node webserver I made in my spare time that (currently) does nothing but serve up javascript files (and other static things). It can load shared files on server and client for fancy code sharing. My plan was to make some cool websocket system for networked games. I may or may not follow through with that.

Dependencies
=============

* Node, of course
* LiveScript version 1.3
* prelude-ls
* rimraf (lol)
* win-spawn (DAMN windows...)
